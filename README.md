### [Supercenter Sales Data Analysis and Customer Segmentation in Python and MySQL](https://github.com/hasiegler/Supercenter_Sales/blob/main/supermarket_sales_analysis.ipynb)
* Analyzed supercenter sales data to create customer spending habit insights, and clustered customers into different groups using unsupervised learning techniques. A SQL database is created and queries are ran to help investigate various questions.

### [Wine Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning Regression Analysis](https://github.com/hasiegler/WineQuality/blob/main/WineQuality.ipynb)
* This project utilizes machine learning regression techniques to predict the quality of wines based on various features, including alcohol percentage, density, color (white or red), and pH. Two regression models, decision tree regression and random forest regression, were implemented to analyze and predict the wine quality. The goal of this project is to explore the effectiveness of these models and provide insights into how to improve the prediction accuracy for wine quality.

### [Interactive Shiny App for Exploratory Data Analysis on Netflix Shows and Movies](https://hasiegler.shinyapps.io/netflix_analysis/)
* Created an interactive app that conducts Exploratory Data Analysis on the movies on Netflix, allowing users to select inputs to analyze various characteristics, enabling a deeper understanding of the types of movies on the platform. The dataset is cleaned and there is data manipulation in each section of the app to find the desired output.
* [Code for the Data Cleaning and Manipulations](https://github.com/hasiegler/Netflix_Analysis/blob/master/data_manipulation.md)
* [Code for Creating the App](https://github.com/hasiegler/Netflix_Analysis/blob/master/app.R)
 
### [Creating the K-Means Clustering Algorithm from Scratch](https://rpubs.com/hasiegler/926806)
* Created the K-means clustering algorithm without using any built in clustering functions, to demonstrate how the algorithm works. I also created a function that saves all of the cluster assignments and centroids for every iteration. This function was used to create an animated visualization of the clustering algorithm iteration by iteration. [Link to GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hasiegler/K_Means_Clustering)

### [Visualizing Space Station Pass Times via API](https://rpubs.com/hasiegler/898179)
* Used the Open-Notify API to create an interactive map that shows when the International Space Station will pass over the US state capitals. [Link to GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hasiegler/Space-Station-API)

### [Creating a Poem from a Dataset](https://github.com/hasiegler/Twelve_Days_Xmas/blob/main/twelve_days_poem.md)
* Created "Twelve Days of Christmas" poem using a dataset with information on all of the items in the poem.

### [National Park Trails Analysis](https://github.com/hasiegler/National_Park_Trails/blob/main/National_Park_Trails.md)
* Statistical analysis using data containing information about every trail in the National Parks Service.
