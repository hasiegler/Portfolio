### [Interactive Crime Map: Analyzing San Francisco Crime Trends](https://hasiegler.shinyapps.io/SFCrimeDashboard/)
* Developed an interactive web application that uses the San Francisco Police Department's API to retrieve daily crime data, enabling users to visualize recent crimes on an interactive map and explore additional analytics to better understand when and where crimes are occurring in the city
* [Link to Code to Create App](https://github.com/hasiegler/SFCrimeDashboard/blob/master/app.R)
* R, Shiny Apps, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, APIs

### [Supercenter Sales Analysis and Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/hasiegler/Supercenter_Sales/blob/main/supermarket_sales_analysis.ipynb)
* Created a MySQL database and analyzed supercenter sales data, creating insights on customer spending habits. Employed clustering algorithms to cluster customers into distinct segments, providing insights for targeted marketing and business strategy
* Python, MySQL, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, K-Means Clustering

### [Wine Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning Regression Analysis](https://github.com/hasiegler/WineQuality/blob/main/WineQuality.ipynb)
* Created machine learning regression models using decision tree and random forest regression to predict wine quality based on alcohol percentage, density, color, and pH. Evaluated model effectiveness and provided insights for improving prediction accuracy
* Python, Statistics, Machine Learning, scikit-learn

### [Creating the K-Means Clustering Algorithm from Scratch](https://rpubs.com/hasiegler/926806)
* Created the K-means clustering algorithm without using any built in clustering functions, to demonstrate how the algorithm works. I also created a function that saves all of the cluster assignments and centroids for every iteration. This function was used to create an animated visualization of the clustering algorithm iteration by iteration.

### [Interactive App for Exploratory Data Analysis on Netflix Shows and Movies](https://hasiegler.shinyapps.io/netflix_analysis/)
* Created an interactive app that conducts Exploratory Data Analysis on the movies on Netflix, allowing users to select inputs to analyze various characteristics, enabling a deeper understanding of the types of movies on the platform. The dataset is cleaned and there is data manipulation in each section of the app to find the desired output.
* [Code for the Data Cleaning and Manipulations](https://github.com/hasiegler/Netflix_Analysis/blob/master/data_manipulation.md)
* [Code for Creating the App](https://github.com/hasiegler/Netflix_Analysis/blob/master/app.R)

### [National Park Trails Analysis](https://github.com/hasiegler/National_Park_Trails/blob/main/National_Park_Trails.md)
* Statistical analysis using data containing information about every trail in the National Parks Service.

### [Creating a Poem from a Dataset](https://github.com/hasiegler/Twelve_Days_Xmas/blob/main/twelve_days_poem.md)
* Created "Twelve Days of Christmas" poem using a dataset with information on all of the items in the poem.
