### [Project 1: Supercenter Sales Data Analysis and Customer Segmentation in Python and MySQL](https://github.com/hasiegler/Supercenter_Sales/blob/main/supermarket_sales_analysis.ipynb)
* Analyzed supercenter sales data to create customer spending habit insights, and clustered customers into different groups using unsupervised learning techniques. A SQL database is created and queries are ran to help investigate various questions.

### [Project 2: Interactive Shiny App for Exploratory Data Analysis on Netflix Shows and Movies](https://hasiegler.shinyapps.io/netflix_analysis/)
* Created an interactive app that conducts Exploratory Data Analysis on the movies on Netflix, allowing users to select inputs to analyze various characteristics, enabling a deeper understanding of the types of movies on the platform. The dataset is cleaned and there is data manipulation in each section of the app to find the desired output.
* [Code for the Data Cleaning and Manipulations](https://github.com/hasiegler/Netflix_Analysis/blob/master/data_manipulation.md)
* [Code for Creating the App](https://github.com/hasiegler/Netflix_Analysis/blob/master/app.R)
 
### [Project 3: Creating the K-Means Clustering Algorithm from Scratch](https://rpubs.com/hasiegler/926806)
* Created the K-means clustering algorithm without using any built in clustering functions, to demonstrate how the algorithm works. I also created a function that saves all of the cluster assignments and centroids for every iteration. This function was used to create an animated visualization of the clustering algorithm iteration by iteration. [Link to GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hasiegler/K_Means_Clustering)

### [Project 4: Visualizing Space Station Pass Times via API](https://rpubs.com/hasiegler/898179)
* Used the Open-Notify API to create an interactive map that shows when the International Space Station will pass over the US state capitals. [Link to GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hasiegler/Space-Station-API)

### [Project 5: Creating a Poem from a Dataset](https://github.com/hasiegler/Twelve_Days_Xmas/blob/main/twelve_days_poem.md)
* Created "Twelve Days of Christmas" poem using a dataset with information on all of the items in the poem.

### [Project 6: National Park Trails Analysis](https://github.com/hasiegler/National_Park_Trails/blob/main/National_Park_Trails.md)
* Statistical analysis using data containing information about every trail in the National Parks Service.
