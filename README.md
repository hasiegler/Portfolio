### [Project 1: Supercenter Sales Data Analysis in Python and MySQL](https://github.com/hasiegler/Supercenter_Sales/blob/main/supermarket_sales_analysis.ipynb)
* Data analysis in Python of sales data for a supercenter company in Myanmar. Each row of the dataset contains information for a single shopping run for a given customer, including information such as on who the customer is, the amount they spent, and what they rated their shopping experience. The data is analyzed to find insights that would be of benefit to the company. A SQL database is created and queries are ran to help investigate various questions.

### [Project 2: Interactive Shiny App for Exploratory Data Analysis on Netflix Shows and Movies](https://hasiegler.shinyapps.io/netflix_analysis/)
* Interactive app that allows the user to perform an EDA on Netflix Shows and Movies using interactive graphs and tables. Data manipulation on dataset from kaggle.com. [Link to GitHub Code](https://github.com/hasiegler/Netflix_Analysis/blob/master/app.R)
 
### [Project 3: Creating the K-Means Clustering Algorithm from Scratch](https://rpubs.com/hasiegler/926806)
* Created the K-means clustering algorithm without using any built in clustering functions, to demonstrate how the algorithm works. I also created a function that saves all of the cluster assignments and centroids for every iteration. This function was used to create an animated visualization of the clustering algorithm iteration by iteration. [Link to GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hasiegler/K_Means_Clustering)

### [Project 4: Visualizing Space Station Pass Times via API](https://rpubs.com/hasiegler/898179)
* Used the Open-Notify API to create an interactive map that shows when the International Space Station will pass over the US state capitals. [Link to GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hasiegler/Space-Station-API)

### [Project 5: Creating a Poem from a Dataset](https://github.com/hasiegler/Twelve_Days_Xmas/blob/main/twelve_days_poem.md)
* Created "Twelve Days of Christmas" poem using a dataset with information on all of the items in the poem.

### [Project 6: National Park Trails Analysis](https://github.com/hasiegler/National_Park_Trails/blob/main/National_Park_Trails.md)
* Statistical analysis using data containing information about every trail in the National Parks Service.
